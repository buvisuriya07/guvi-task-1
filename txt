Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
 HTTP:
          Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol that is, currently, the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. 
HTTP is based on the Client/Server model. Client/Server model can be explained as two computers, Client (receiver of service) and Server (provider of service) that are communicating via requests and responses.

HTTP/2:
In 2015, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) release HTTP/2, the second major version of the most useful internet protocol, HTTP. It was derived from the earlier experimental SPDY protocol.

Main goals of developing HTTP/2 was:

Protocol negotiation mechanism — protocol electing, eg. HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 or other.
High-level compatibility with HTTP/1.1 — methods, status codes, URIs and header fields.
Page load speed improvements trough:
Compression of request headers
Binary protocol
HTTP/2 Server Push
Request multiplexing over a single TCP connection
Request pipelining
HOL blocking (Head-of-line) — Package blocking

HTTP/1.1
1.It works on the textual format.
2.There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
3.It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
4.It compresses data by itself.

HTTP/2
1.It works on the binary protocol.
2.It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
3.It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
4.It uses HPACK for data compression.


2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

objects:
An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.

Syntax:

new Object(value)

Object(value)

let object_name = {
    key_name : value,
    ...
}

EXAMPLE:
/ JavaScript code demonstrating a simple object
let school = {
    name: 'G.S.Hindu hr.sec.school',
    location : 'srivilliputtur',
    established : '1971',
    displayInfo : function(){
        console.log(`${school.name} was established 
              in ${school.established} at ${school.location}`);
    }
}
school.displayInfo();
